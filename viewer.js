That is the real calendar: the DA for day D+1 clears at 12:00 on D, after D's IDA3 at 10:00. A day can then hand on which gas and coal plants are running at midnight (the arrow), so a plant started late on Day 1 stays on into Day 2 (minimum up/down time, start costs). Without on/off rules nothing is handed on, and both orders give the same prices (tested, model change §16).
